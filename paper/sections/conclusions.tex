\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Overall findings indicate that AMDâ€™s \gls{SMU} (via the \texttt{ryzen\_smu} kernel
driver) and the \gls{RAPL} interface provide different numerical estimates of
energy consumption for identical workloads and have no proven correlation or
similarity.

While this does not preclude the existence of more subtle "trends" and
similarities, such effects were not detectable within the scope and time
constraints of the present work.

Large discrepancies in absolute values can be explained by both imperfections
in the \emph{Ryzen Plugin} implementation (values interpretation and/or conversion
errors, numerical types conversion issues, inappropriate/imperfect method for
integrating power into energy, etc.) and lack of official documentation regarding
the access to these values.

Nevertheless, the author is convinced that AMD telemetry access interfaces may
offer advantages over alternatives in several important respects, provided the
deficiencies in the methodology and implementations presented in this paper are
addressed. Potential areas for these improvements and other details are described
in the next section.
