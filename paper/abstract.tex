\section*{Abstract}

With the increasing demand for computational power, driven by the rapid
development of software systems directly or indirectly leveraging
artificial intelligence (AI), as well as critical infrastructure applications
requiring the use of \gls{HPC} (such as flood or tsunami simulations), the
need for accurate energy measurement tools for computing systems continues to
grow. In addition, global trends toward sustainability and responsible energy
consumption further emphasize the importance of high-quality energy profiling.

As \gls{CPU} represents the core component of a modern computing system,
accurate measurement of its energy consumption plays a crucial role.
Such data can be applied in multiple contexts, including the software
solutions optimization, energy-aware billing models, and performance
evaluation in \gls{HPC} environments.

While Intel has long dominated the \gls{CPU} market, AMD has also developed
processors targeting server and cluster workloads, providing various telemetry
capabilities including support for Intel’s \gls{RAPL} interface and other
AMD-specific solutions. The latter include kernel modules and community-driven
open-source tools exposing telemetry features of AMD hardware.

This research aims to conduct a comparative analysis of energy measurement
interfaces available on AMD \gls{CPU}s, focusing on the evaluation of accuracy,
resolution, and usability. Specifically, the study contrasts Intel-inspired
\gls{RAPL} with AMD’s native telemetry mechanisms in order to determine their
strengths, limitations, and potential applications in modern energy-aware
computing.
